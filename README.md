\# 🐶 Dog Image Annotation Project



This project demonstrates bounding box annotations for dog images using the Open Images Dataset. It includes filtering, visualization, and Pascal VOC XML conversion—just like a professional annotator would do.



\## 📁 Folder Structure



\- `images/`: Raw dog images

\- `xml\_annotations/`: Pascal VOC XML files

\- `dog\_annotations\_filtered.csv`: Filtered bounding box data

\- `filter\_dog\_annotations.py`: CSV filtering script

\- `visualize\_annotations.py`: Bounding box visualization script

\- `convert\_to\_pascal\_voc.py`: XML conversion script



\## 🎯 Goal



To build a hands-on portfolio for data annotation roles by simulating a real-world workflow.
